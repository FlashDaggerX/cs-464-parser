Reminders:
1. You do not need a separate token (number) for each operator. All of them should be translated to one token (number) which is OPERATOR. See below
2. In the switch the code for identifier and literal is complete. Do not change it
3. Symbol `e` means epsilon.

BNF grammar of Mini Language:

	Program --> "(" Sequence State ")"
	Sequence --> "(" Statements ")"
	Statements --> Statements Stmt | e
	Stmt --> "(" {NullStatement | Assignment | Conditional | Loop | Block} ")"
	State --> "(" Pairs ")"
	Pairs --> Pairs Pair | e
	Pair --> "(" Identifier Literal ")"
	NullStatement --> "skip"
	Assignment --> "assign" Identifier Expression
	Conditional --> "conditional" Expression Stmt Stmt
	Loop --> "loop" Expression Stmt
	Block --> "block" Statements
	Expression --> Identifier | Literal | "(" Operation Expression Expression ")"
	Operation --> "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "=" | "!=" | "or" | "and"

Or with single symbols:

	S --> "(" J T ")"
	J --> "(" H ")"
	H --> H M | e
	M --> "(" {G} ")"
	G --> N | A | C | L | B
	T --> "(" I ")"
	I --> I R | e
	R --> "(" D E ")"
	N --> "skip"
	A --> "assign" D X
	C --> "conditional" X M M
	L --> "loop" X M
	B --> "block" H
	X --> D | E | "(" O X X ")"
	O --> "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "=" | "!=" | "or" | "and"
	D --> <Identifier>
	E --> <Literal>

**Treat Identifier and Literal as terminal symbols. Every symbol inside `"` and `"` is a terminal symbol. The rest are non terminals.**

	Line: 5, spelling = [1234], kind = 1
	Line 6: wrong token !

**After you get an error message for the symbol `=` remove this symbol and
run the program. Repeat this until the last wrong token which is: `?`**

You should get the following error messges:

	Line 6: wrong token `!`
	Line 6: wrong token `?`
